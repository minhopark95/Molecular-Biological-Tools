# Molecular-Biological-Tools

Hello!

This program is for Molecular biological works such as molecular cloning, DNA design, primer design, etc.

--This program can be used to
  - Counting DNA length and calculating GC content
  - Finding DNA seq location (seq number <-> seq you want to find)
  - RNA, DNA moles <-> mass
  - Generating complementray seq (separately or dsDNA)
  - Generating reverse seq
  - Translation
  - Simple DNA, a.a. seq alignment
  - Counting a.a. seq length and calculating molecular weight
  - Finding a.a. seq location (seq number <-> seq you want to find)
  - Converting a.a. abbreviation (1 letter abbreviation <-> 3 letter abbreviation)



--How to use this program

Choose what you want to do on the left side
