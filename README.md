# Molecular-Biological-Tools

Hello!

This program is for Molecular biological works such as molecular cloning, DNA design, primer design, etc.

These are what you can do with this program.
  - Counting DNA length and calculating GC content
  - Finding DNA seq location (seq number -> seq  or  seq you want to find -> seq number)
  - RNA, DNA moles <-> mass
  - Creating complementray seq (separately or dsDNA)
  - Arranging in reverse order
  - Translation
  - Simple DNA seq alignment
  - Counting a.a. seq length
  - Finding a.a. seq location (seq number -> seq  or  seq you want to find -> seq number)
  - Converting a.a. abbreviation (1 letter abbreviation <-> 3 letter abbreviation)
