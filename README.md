# Molecular-Biological-Tools

Hello!

This program is for Molecular biological works such as molecular cloning, DNA design, primer design, etc.

--This program can be used to
  - Counting DNA length and calculating GC ratio
  - Finding DNA subseq or seq position (seq position <-> seq you want to find)
  - RNA, DNA moles <-> mass
  - Generating complementray seq (each strand separately or dsDNA)
  - Generating reverse seq
  - Translation
  - Simple DNA, a.a. seq alignment
  - Counting a.a. seq length and calculating molecular weight
  - Finding a.a. sub or seq position (seq position <-> seq you want to find)
  - Converting a.a. abbreviation (1 letter abbreviation <-> 3 letter abbreviation)



--How to use this program

Choose what you want to do on the left side
-> Press choose button
-> Choose option
-> Press clear button
-> Enter all required things
-> Press run button

If you want, you can use .exe file that I made with Pyinstaller.

Thank you :) I hope that this is helpful
